A pop-up shows up where you need to enter the following information:
- System Type: *SAP HANA* (use the dropdown menu)
- Connection: *cptrial* (use the dropdown menu)
- Data Source: *SIMPLEVIEW* (you can also select it with the help button on the right site)
- Name: *simpleModel*

A new screen shows up, where you can see the measures of your calculation view and a preview of the model on the right-hand side.

*Optional: If you are interested, you can also click on All Dimensions to view the dimensions of your calculation view.*

After exploring your model, click *Save Model*
